                    <p>Initially，the documentary will begin with several interviews with montage editing of current students, who come from different countries, speaking totally random words of phrases in their native dialect. It attempts to attract audience’s attention and curiosity by different language to describe their feeling at the beginning. After
that, it continues with the medium close up shot for interview of current students with their names on the
screen, to describe the program completely. It appeals the beginner level of understanding about how
improvisation class improves them. During the interview, it will be some footage from the class to flash in,
and keeps audience getting interest about the progress rather than stay with same scene. Later, there will
be Dr. Pennefather’s voice over on introduction of his class and his way of teaching to differentiate the
speciality of his teaching style. Use existing footage to convey the fun and exciting atmosphere of
                        the class. It should be energetic and make people feel they should be part of this experience.</p>

We are focusing on this special method to improve communication skills and its lecturer/designer Dr. Pennefather. Our goal is presenting the effectiveness of this class and specifically, Ball Game and other games help students to improve their team building and communication skills. And how these games prepare students to meet UX clients. The primary audience is students and professionals who will be inspired by the program and specifically the games. We want to express improvisation is a fun and great way to improve their communication skills in the creative industry.</p>

                       <h5>Reflections: </h5>
                        <p>The final edit has included motion graphics, fixed audio and corrected colors and it has basically represented our final ideas regarding this projects. The changes I have suggested in the rough cut review have been included and realized. There should be some changes regarding the choice of fonts and illustration style in motion graphics. I met some challenges such as thinking the idea of the motion graphics sequence because it should be more creative to match the voice-over and the transition in each scene. Overall i have been investing my time and utilize my skills to make the perfect contribution to the final results of the project.</p>

                       <h5>Reflections: </h5>
                        <p>The documentary have improved a lot compared to our inital plan. In the final edit, I made motion graphic animations to show their “Blindfolded” activity, the “Cups” to illustrate Dr. Pennefather's idea in the begining of the documentary. The fixed audio and corrected colors which basically represented final ideas regarding this projects. The changes I have suggested in the rough cut review have been included and realized. I met some challenges such as thinking the idea of the motion graphics sequence because it should be more creative to match the voice-over and the transition in each scene. Overall i have been investing my time and utilize my skills to make the perfect contribution to the final results of this documentary.</p>

                  <h6>Overview: </h6>
                        <p>Venture Compass is an app which helps with overall preparation by providing users with clear yet flexible trip plans that help them prepare rest stops and destinations along the way. The equipment suggestor helps less experienced users prepare for trips by providing trip-specific equipment based on environment and expected weather. </p>

                     <h6>Feature Descriptions</h6>
                    <p>Milestone tracking is the most important feature, so my idea about this feature is accomplished by having the app track the user’s trip through the various stops they make along the way. As the user journey map i designed shows above. Once a trip is finished, users can review it and see all the places they’ve been. Along the way, they’ll be given the estimated time remaining on their trip. If they ever decide to venture off-course, Venture Compass will help guide them back when needed, and adjust the time left to their destination. We can continue implementing danger signals for hikes the users would come across during their trip. I think when they tap on a hiking area, key information such as difficulty level, danger precautions, and hike duration will all be given at a glance. A trail map with danger areas will also be provided. Services can be communicated via campsite information cards, where things such as washrooms, showers, and available food can be viewed.</p>

                    <h4>Descriptions and Process</h4>
                  <p>Humanity In-Dependence consists of a single screen projection of an image that can change based off of audience interaction.</p>
                      <p>The audience can interact with the
artwork by shining a flashlight at the light sensor located inside the grey box
container. Upon detecting the flashlight, the screen will switch back and forth between
that of a human face and a robotic face. The challenge I met was the projected image was initially a static image. I should make the image to be more dynamic prior to the prompt of the flashlight so that the artwork is less static when seen from a distance. To solve the problem, I re-programmed in the processing of the image. so that it would fade back and forth between the two images via a timer.The audience can continue manipulate the image for as long as they have the flashlight aimed at the light sensor or until they decide to leave. The project requires a person to input a light source in reality which will manipulate the digital space through a computer. I found that the primary visual feedback given by digital image manipulation requires both human and machine working together for a successful interaction to take place.</p>
