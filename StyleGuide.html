                        <p>The effectiveness of improvisation in developing communication and collaborations skills among teams in an emerging multicultural world.</p>
                      <h5>Overview: </h5>
<<<<<<< HEAD:StyleGuide.html
                        <p>Master of Digital Media (MDM) program at the Center for Digital media is a special program that aims to improve communication skills of students and professionals that are in creative industries through improvisation. So I am focusing on this special method to improve communication skills and its lecturer/designer Dr. Pennefather. <strong>My goal is presenting the effectiveness of this class and specifically, Ball Game and other games help students to improve their team building and communication skills. And how these games prepare students to meet UX clients. </strong>The primary audience is students and professionals who will be inspired by the program and specifically the games. In the documentary, I want to express improvisation as a fun and great way to improve their communication skills in the creative industry.</p>

              <h2>Venture Compass App design</h2>
            <img src="image/projects/interface1.png" alt="Processing_result">
              <h5>Overview: </h5>
                        <p>Venture Compass is an app which helps with overall preparation by providing users with clear yet flexible trip plans that help them prepare rest stops and destinations along the way. The equipment suggestor helps less experienced users prepare for trips by providing trip-specific equipment based on environment and expected weather. </p>
                     <h5>Feature Descriptions</h5>
<<<<<<< HEAD:StyleGuide.html
                   <p>Milestone tracking is the most important feature, so my idea about this feature is accomplished by having the app track the user’s trip through the various stops they make along the way. As the user journey map i designed shows above. Once a trip is finished, users can review it and see all the places they’ve been. Along the way, they’ll be given the estimated time remaining on their trip. If they ever decide to venture off-course, Venture Compass will help guide them back when needed, and adjust the time left to their destination. We can continue implementing danger signals for hikes the users would come across during their trip. I think when they tap on a hiking area, key information such as difficulty level, danger precautions, and hike duration will all be given at a glance. A trail map with danger areas will also be provided. Services can be communicated via campsite information cards, where things such as washrooms, showers, and available food can be viewed.</p>
